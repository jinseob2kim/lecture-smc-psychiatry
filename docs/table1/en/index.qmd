# Executive Summary 

- Comparison of two groups (continuous variables): If normality is assumed, use a **t-test**; otherwise, use the **Wilcoxon test**.

- Comparison of three or more groups (continuous variables): If normality is assumed, use **one-way ANOVA**; otherwise, use the **Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA**.

- Comparison of categorical variables: If the sample size is sufficient, use the **Chi-square test**; otherwise, use the **Fisher's exact test**.

## What is Descriptive Statistics?

- Refers to the **numbers that summarize data** —such as the mean, median, variance, and frequency tables— and **graphs** such as histograms and box plots.

- However, instead of presenting simple descriptive statistics, most medical research focuses on **comparing them across groups**, as shown in **Table 1** (ex: by sex or disease status).

```{r, echo = F}
include_graphics("https://blog.zarathu.com/posts/2018-11-24-basic-biostatistics/table1.jpg")
```

# Research Flow

1. Present the data using **descriptive statistics**
2. Test hypotheses using **univariate analysis**
3. Use **multivariate or subgroup analysis** to control for effects of other variables  

- Many simple studies end with univariate analysis, which is essentially equivalent to comparing descriptive statistics across groups.

- Therefore, understanding the statistics required for **Table 1** alone can be sufficient for conducting basic medical research.

# Grouped Comparison of <br><b>Continuous Variables</b>

# 2 Groups: T-test

Comparison of **means** between the two groups

- Requires the mean and standard deviation of each group.

- Can be performed directly at: [T-test Calculator](https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/t-test.html)

## Data Table

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.t <- read_excel(here("data", "data_t.xlsx"))
datatable(data.t, rownames = FALSE, caption = "data.t: sex and total cholesterol")
```

<img src="images/spss_ttest.png">

## T-test in SPSS

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(
  normalizePath(here::here("images", c("spss_ttest.png", "spss_ttest2.png")))
)
```

- Go to **Analyze → Compare Means and Proportions → Independent-Samples T Test**
- Test Variable: `tChol`  
- Grouping Variable: `sex` (Female, Male)  

## T-test in SPSS

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='85%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "spss_ttest3.png"))
```

The mean difference in cholesterol (2.85) was not significant (p = .759 / .721) and the 95% CI included 0, indicating no difference between sexes.

- SPSS provides results for both cases: **Equal variances assumed** and **not assumed**.

- The second row (Welch’s t-test) is used **when equal variances are not assumed**.

- Assuming equal variances simplifies computation, but making this assumption without justification can be risky. Unless justified, use **"Equal variances not assumed"**.

- Running ANOVA on two groups is equivalent to a **t-test assuming equal variances**. There is also a version of ANOVA that does **not** assume equal variances.

## Boxplot in SPSS

Go to **Graphs → Boxplot…**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "box1.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Select **Simple** and **Summaries for groups of cases**, then click **Define**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "box2.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Set `tChol` as the **Variable** and `sex` as the **Category Axis**, then click **OK**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "box3.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

The boxplot displays the distribution of cholesterol levels by sex.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "boxplot1.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```


## Barplot in SPSS

Go to **Graphs → Bar…**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "bar1.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Select **Simple** and **Summaries for groups of cases**, then click **Define**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "bar2.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Set `tChol` as the **Variable** (e.g., `MEAN(tChol)`) and `sex` as the **Category Axis**, then click **OK**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "barplot1.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

The bar chart displays the **mean cholesterol levels** by sex.


# 2 Groups: Wilcoxon Test

When normality cannot be assumed: compare **medians** between two groups

- Uses rank information instead of raw values — a **nonparametric test**
- Results are typically presented as **Median [IQR (25%–75% quantile)]**

A formal normality test is **not necessary** to decide whether to use this method.

It is better to rely on **clinical judgment**.  
For example, height and weight often follow a normal distribution,  
while CRP levels or number of children typically do not.

- [Reference for Normal Distribution](https://jinseob2kim.github.io/Normal_distribution.html)

## Wilcoxon Test in SPSS

Go to **Transform → Automatic Recode…**.

Select the string variable `sex` to recode, and enter a new name like `sex_num` in the New Name field.

Click **Add New Name** then **OK**. SPSS will automatically assign numeric codes `'Male' → 1` and `'Female' → 2`.

Go to **Analyze → Nonparametric Tests → Legacy Dialogs → 2 Independent Samples…**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "wilx4.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Set `tChol` as the **Test Variable** and `sex_num` as the **Grouping Variable**, then click **Define Groups** and enter `1` and `2`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "wilx5.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "wilx6.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

The output provides the **Mann–Whitney U test results**, including ranks and p-value.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "wilx7.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

# 3 or More Groups: One-way ANOVA

Comparison of means across three or more groups

- **ANOVA** tests whether **at least one group differs significantly** from the others overall.
- It tells you if there is a difference, but not **which groups are different** (run **post-hoc** analysis to determine which groups differ).

The **standard ANOVA** assumes **equal variances across all groups**, and when comparing only two groups, it produces the same result as a **t-test assuming equal variances**.

There is also a **generalized ANOVA** that **does not assume equal variances**, and our institution uses this as the default.

## Standard ANOVA in SPSS

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.aov <- read_excel(here("data", "data_aov.xlsx"))
datatable(data.aov, rownames = FALSE, caption = "data.aov: group and total cholesterol")
```

## Standard ANOVA in SPSS

Go to **Transform → Automatic Recode…**.

Select the string variable `group` to recode, and enter a new name like `group_num` in the New Name field.

Click **Add New Name** then **OK**. SPSS will automatically assign numeric codes `'A' → 1`, `'B' → 2`, `'C' → 3`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "aov3.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Go to **Analyze → Compare Means and Proportions → One-Way ANOVA…**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "aov4.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Set `tChol` as the **Dependent List** and `group_num` as the **Factor**, then click **OK**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "aov5.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

The output displays the **F-statistic**, **p-value**, and **effect sizes** such as eta-squared.

## Generalized ANOVA in SPSS

Go to **One-Way ANOVA… → Options…** and check **Welch test** to account for unequal variances.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "aov4-1.png")))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "aov4-2.png")))
```
> Use the **$p$-value = 0.020 from unequal variance ANOVA**, which indicates a **statistically significant difference** in total cholesterol among the three groups.

# 3 or More Groups: Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA

When normality cannot be assumed: compare **medians** across three or more groups

- Uses rank information instead of raw values — a **nonparametric test**

- Results are typically presented as **Median [IQR (25%–75% quantile)]**

## Kruskal–Wallis Test in SPSS

Go to **Analyze → Nonparametric Tests → Legacy Dialogs → K Independent Samples…**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "kw1.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Move `tChol` into the **Test Variable List** and `group_num` into the **Grouping Variable** field.  
Click **Define Range…** and enter minimum = `1`, maximum = `3`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "kw2.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "kw3.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Click **OK** to run the test. The output will include rank comparisons and the Kruskal–Wallis H statistic.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "kw4.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

> Use the **$p$-value = 0.025** from the **Kruskal–Wallis test**, which indicates a **statistically significant difference** in total cholesterol across the three groups.

# Group Comparison of Categorical Variables
**Much simpler than for continuous variables — no need to consider the number of groups or normality.** The only thing to check is whether the **sample size is sufficient**.

# Sufficient Sample Size: <br><b>Chi-square Test</b>

The **Chi-square test** is used to determine whether two categorical variables are associated.

- It can also be applied to three or more categorical variables,  
  but this lecture will not cover those cases.

## Chi-square Test in SPSS
```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.chi <- read_excel(here("data", "data_chi.xlsx"))
datatable(data.chi, rownames = FALSE, caption = "data.chi: HTN & DM medication")
```

## Chi-square Test in SPSS

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "chi3.png")))
```

At a glance, it’s hard to tell whether there is an association.  
Let’s perform a **Chi-square test** to find out.

## Chi-Square Test in SPSS

Go to **Analyze → Descriptive Statistics → Crosstabs…**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "chi1.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Set one variable `HTN_medi` as the **Row(s)** variable and another `DM_medi` as the **Column(s)** variable.  
Click **Statistics…** and check **Chi-square**, then click **Continue**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "chi2.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Click **OK** to run the test.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "chi4.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

> Use **p-value = 0.474**, which indicates that there is **no statistically significant association** between hypertension medication and diabetes medication use.

# Insufficient Sample Size: Fisher’s Exact Test

When a category in the table being analyzed has a very small sample size, the **Chi-square test** becomes unreliable. In such cases, use **Fisher's Exact Test** instead.

- Fisher's test calculates the [direct probability](https://techntalk.tistory.com/entry/%ED%94%BC%EC%85%94%EC%9D%98-%EC%A0%95%ED%99%95%EB%8F%84-%EA%B2%80%EC%A0%95Fishers-Exact-Probability-Test) of observing a result as extreme or more extreme than the current one.

## Fisher’s Exact Test in SPSS

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.fish <- read_excel(here("data", "data_fish.xlsx"))
datatable(data.fish, rownames = FALSE, caption = "data.fish: HTN & DM medication")
```

## Fisher’s Exact Test in SPSS

For this new dataset, let's first try applying the Chi-squared test.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "fish1.png"))
```

Since **only 2 people are taking both medications**, one of the cells in the contingency table has a very small sample size.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "fish2.png"))
```

SPSS gives us the following warning: **"1 cells (25.0%) have expected count less than 5. The minimum expected count is 2.20."** This violates the Chi-square test's assumptions, making its result unreliable. In such cases, it's better to use Fisher’s Exact Test, which does not rely on large sample approximations.

## Fisher’s Exact Test in SPSS

Let’s try the **Fisher’s exact test** instead.
The first steps are the same as for Chi-Square.

In **Crosstabs…**, go to **Cells…** then ensure **Observed** is checked under **Counts**.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "fish3.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Then, go to **Exact...** to check **Exact** to request Fisher's Exact Test.
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "fish4.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "fish5.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```
> Fisher’s Exact Test indicated no statistically significant association between the two variables, p = 1.000 (2-sided).

## Question: If Fisher’s test works in all cases, why not just always use it instead of the Chi-square test?

- When sample sizes are small, **Fisher’s exact test** is indeed simpler and methodologically sound.
  However, as sample size or the number of groups increases, the **computational burden of Fisher’s test** grows rapidly. Therefore, it is generally recommended to try the **Chi-square test** first.

# Paired Group Comparison for Continuous Variables

# 2 Groups: Paired t-test

Suppose each person’s blood pressure was measured once manually and once using an automatic device.  
Is a **t-test** sufficient to compare the two sets of measurements?

- A regular t-test calculates the **mean of each method** first and tests whether they are equal,  
  which **fails to utilize the paired nature** of the data.

- A better approach is to **first calculate the difference** between the two measurements for each person,  
  and then test whether the **mean of these differences is zero**.  
  This method both **uses the paired structure** and is computationally simpler.

- The method of testing whether the **mean of the differences is zero** is called the **paired t-test**.

## Paired Samples T-Test in SPSS
```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.pt <- read_excel(here("data", "data_pt.xlsx"))
datatable(data.pt, rownames = FALSE, caption = "data.pt: systolic blood pressure measured by hand & machine")
```

## Paired Samples T-Test in SPSS

Go to **Analyze → Compare Means → Paired-Samples T Test…**
```{r, echo = F, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "pt1.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Select the two related variables (e.g., `SBP_hand` and `SBP_machine`) and move them into the **Paired Variables** box.
```{r, echo = F, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "pt2.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```

Interpret the **Sig. (2-tailed)** value in the output.
```{r, echo = F, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "pt3.png"), mustWork = FALSE))
```
The test calculated the difference in SBP for each individual and then tested whether the mean of those differences was significantly different from zero, resulting in a p-value of 0.648.

## Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

The nonparametric version of the **paired t-test** is the **Wilcoxon signed-rank test**,  
which can be performed as follows:

Go to **Analyze → Nonparametric Tests → Related Samples…**
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "wst1.png")))
```

Select the two related variables (e.g., `SBP_hand` and `SBP_machine`) and move them into the **Test Fields** box under the **Fields** tab.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "wst2.png")))
```

Go to the **Settings** tab, select **Customize tests**, and check **Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank (2 samples)**.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "wst3.png")))
```

Interpret the **Asymptotic Sig. (2-sided)** value in the output.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "wst4.png")))
```

The test ranked the differences in SBP between hand and machine measurements for each individual and tested whether the median difference was significantly different from zero. The result was a *p*-value of **0.940** — there is no statistically significant difference.

- Although it will not be covered in this lecture, when comparing three or more paired groups, use [**repeated measure ANOVA**](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/repeated-measures-anova-statistical-guide.php).

# Paired Group Comparison for Categorical Variables
**McNemar Test, Symmetry Test for a Paired Contingency Table**

# 2 Groups: McNemar Test

- Suppose we want to examine whether there is a difference in abdominal pain symptoms **before and after taking a medication**.
- The chi-squared test examines the overall association between abdominal pain before and after taking the medication, but it does **not** account for the fact that the data are **paired** (i.e., measured on the same individuals).  
- To properly analyze paired data, we should use the **McNemar test** instead.

## McNemar Test in SPSS

Go to **Analyze → Descriptive Statistics → Crosstabs…**  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "mc1.png")))
```

Set `Pain_before` as the **Row(s)** variable and `Pain_after` as the **Column(s)** variable. Click **Statistics…**, then check **McNemar**.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "mc2.png")))
```

Click **OK** to run the test.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(here::here("images", "mc3.png")))
```

> The **McNemar test** analyzes only the participants whose responses **changed between `Pain_before` and `Pain_after`** —  these are the **discordant pairs** (e.g., from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0).  
The **concordant pairs** (e.g., 0 to 0 or 1 to 1) do **not affect** the test result.


# Three Groups: Symmetry Test

Symmetry test for a paired contingency table

- A generalization of the **McNemar test**, applicable to **three or more categories**.
- SPSS does not offer a built-in symmetry test for paired categorical variables with three or more categories.
- Consider using R or Zarathu’s web application.

# Review 

- Comparison of two groups (continuous variables): If normality is assumed, use a T-test; otherwise, use the Wilcoxon test.

- Comparison of three or more groups (continuous variables): If normality is assumed, use one-way ANOVA; otherwise, use the Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA.

- Comparison of categorical variables: If the sample size is sufficient, use the Chi-square test; otherwise, use the Fisher’s exact test.
